Flamework-Persona
=========

Pieces of the puzzle to log in to a Flamework project via Persona/BrowserID

STOP NOW
=========

This is still very much a work in progress.

Notes
---

This only sort of works at the moment. It relies heavily on the code sample provided here 

https://github.com/altryne/browserID-jQuery

Currently we can log a user in via their Persona/BrowserID account. We can also register a new user if one does not exist in the Flamework project. 

Logging out doesn't mean you are logging out of your Persona/BrowserID account right now.

Workflow for logging in and registering needs lots of work.

lib_browserid.php needs to be re-formatted.

Need to add option to use self-hosted browserID server/provider.
